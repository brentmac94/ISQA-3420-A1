#Executive Summary#

This repository includes a level 0 Data Flow Diagram (DFD), three Use Cases, and a Data Dictionary. The primary purpose of these documents is to manage the connection between the internal corporation and the external environment.

This repository is built around four management principles: Motivation, Organizational Structure, Authority & Control, and Social repsonsibility.

**Motivation:** What are we doing this? The motivation behind this system is simple - we want to manage the digital world as it becomes more complex by the minute. With this, the system is meant to make reliable use of Open Source Software within the organization. Open Source Software is becoming increasingly popular and usable for organizations. However, poor management of OSS leads to poor OSS for the organization and the entire OSS community. This system ensures the most reliable and usable OSS within the digital world.
<br><br>
**Organizational Structure:** What changes need to be made to the organization? <br> This new system both management and developers to continually communicate when new software projects are being created in regards to OSS licensing, policies, and vulnerabilities.
<br> <br>
**Authority & Control:** Who has inherited new responsibilities? <br> The Manager is responsible for updating policies and overseeing software project license and vulnerability information. <br> The Developer is responsible for developing new software and adhering to all license, policy, and vulnerabilities within the software.
<br><br>
**Social Responsibility:** The Manager and the Developers alike have the social responsibility to release Open Source Software the adheres to all to OSS licenses, has updated policies, and is protected from as many vulnerabilities as possible. This will allow the community to develop further on the on the OSS as much as possible.
